        "Python has several tools (packages) for building applications and websites – with perhaps the most well-known being [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). However, while many of these are excellent tools, the benefit of using Flask is that it is a microframework – which is a long-winded way of saying it is possible to make lightweight (i.e. small and simple) apps as well as more complicated ones. Also, this \"lightweight-iness\" means that, comapred with Django and similar, Flask is less opionated on how you build a web app and more flexible. To begin with, we will start by installing the relevant packages:"
